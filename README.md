# Tinkering with Claude 3.7 Sonnet to optimize code
Tinkering with Claude 3.7 Sonnet. A comment was made that by asking a model to generate better code, it could generate more optimized code.

Iterated over a few examples of HumanEval to test that theory.
Although it's hard to measure execution with how small HumanEval tests are, it would be interesting to scale it to harder problems!
